\chapter{Rationale}

Every year, Makerere University admits over 10,000 privately sponsored students majority of who reside in privately owned hostels outside the campus. There is literally no monitoring and rating mechanism for any of these hostels, leaving them to set their own rules and minimum living standards.
This research seeks to provide tangible data, based on both resident ratings and other key metrics.
