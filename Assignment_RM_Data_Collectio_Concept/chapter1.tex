\chapter{Introduction}

The Ministry of Education and Sports outlines a few of the minimum standards that education facilities must meet before being approved for operation. While frequently overlooked, places of accommodation play a vital role in students' happiness and general performance while in school. In tertiary institutions such as Makerere University, a majority of the students reside outside the halls of residence provided by the University. This poses a challenge in monitoring and keeping living conditions and  environments in these areas up to par. The research seeks to assess these living conditions and ensure compliance with rules from both MOES and NHCE.
